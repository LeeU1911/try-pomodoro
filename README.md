What is Pomodoro technique? 
In short, it is a technique to boost your productivity in daily work. 

It has below steps:

1. At the beginning of the day, list out and prioritize your tasks
2. Work on your task for a Pomodoro (25 minutes) without distraction.
3. When 25 minutes is up, record an X for that task.
4. Take a 5-minute short-break
5. Every 4 Pomodoros, take a 15-minute long-break
 * Some tips:
    1. When you're working in a Pomodoro, if there is any distraction, record an -, note down the distraction to do it later
    2. When Pomodoro is up, stop doing immediately.
    3. During break time, don't think or discuss about the tasks
